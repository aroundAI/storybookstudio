# StorybookStudio v0.3.25

StorybookStudio agents can now discover and run compatible ComfyUI graphs saved under Generate > My Workflows. This brings personal workflows into the same MCP-driven generation path as StorybookStudio's bundled workflows while keeping unsupported graphs visible with clear setup guidance.

## Highlights

- **My Workflows discovery for agents.** `list_storybookstudio_workflows` now includes graphs saved in Generate > My Workflows, with a dedicated source filter for personal workflows.
- **Agent-ready workflow IDs.** Compatible saved graphs receive a stable `my-workflow:` ID that agents can pass to the existing prompt-generation tool.
- **Clear readiness checks.** StorybookStudio reports detected marker nodes, expected output type, required inputs, and any missing setup before an agent attempts a generation.
- **Image and video outputs.** Saved workflows can expose either `STORYBOOKSTUDIO_OUTPUT_IMAGE` or `STORYBOOKSTUDIO_OUTPUT_VIDEO` and use the same preview-and-approve generation flow as bundled workflows.
- **Optional custom inputs.** Saved graphs can advertise supported image, audio, seed, size, frame-rate, and duration controls through StorybookStudio marker nodes.
- **Safer unsupported workflows.** Arbitrary saved graphs remain discoverable, but StorybookStudio blocks execution until the required `STORYBOOKSTUDIO_PROMPT` and output markers are present instead of failing deep inside ComfyUI.

## Downloads

Ignore the auto-generated source-code archives unless you plan to build StorybookStudio from source.

## Notes

- To make a saved graph runnable by an agent, title its prompt node `STORYBOOKSTUDIO_PROMPT` and its final save node `STORYBOOKSTUDIO_OUTPUT_IMAGE` or `STORYBOOKSTUDIO_OUTPUT_VIDEO`, then save it to My Workflows again.
- Agents can inspect personal workflows with `list_storybookstudio_workflows` using the `my-workflows` source filter.
- StorybookStudio still depends on the user's configured ComfyUI connection when running local ComfyUI workflows.
